# HV-outdoor-insulator-surface-condition-classfification
The CNN model with Hyperband Optimization using Keras tuner and Keras sequential model APIs. The dataset was augmented using skimage and Open CV libraries.
The dataset consists of images of four classes of  insulator's surface contamination "snow", "ice", "dust", "no contamination".
